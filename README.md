# Using the transclude function

## Objectives

- Manually transclude DOM into our template without ng-transclude

## Instructions

Take the `UserProfile` directive in this repo. You'll notice that we are currently doing automated transclusion for our elements.

Now that we know how to do manual transclusion, change our directive over to manual transclusion rather than automated.
